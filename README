## Introduction
This project aims to provide comprehensive E2E tests for a pharmacy's web application. Using Cypress with TypeScript, the tests cover various scenarios to ensure the reliability and stability of the production system.

## Features
- **TypeScript Integration**: Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and an improved development experience.
- **Cypress Testing**: Utilizing Cypress for robust and reliable E2E testing.
- **Production Testing**: Executing tests directly in the production environment to validate real-world functionality.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pharmacy-e2e-tests.git
    cd pharmacy-e2e-tests
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration
Before running the tests, make sure to configure the necessary environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

```plaintext
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://your-production-url.com
CYPRESS_USERNAME=your-username
CYPRESS_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following commands:

- **Open Cypress Test Runner**:
    ```bash
    npm run cypress:open
    ```

- **Run Tests in Headless Mode**:
    ```bash
    npm run cypress:run
    ```
